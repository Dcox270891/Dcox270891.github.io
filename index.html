                    Chartwell is an English country house near the town of Westerham, Kent. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill, who lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, until Churchill lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when he was again Prime Minister, the house became his refuge after a debilitating stroke. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent. It was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1966. (Full article...)

                    Mazda6
                    The Mazda6 is a mid-size car produced by Mazda since 2002, replacing the long-produced Capella/626. The car was popular among consumers, selling faster than all previous Mazda models. The Mazda6 was marketed as the first example of the company's "Stylish, Insightful, and Spirited" design philosophy, followed by the Mazda2 in December 2002, the RX-8 in August 2003, the Mazda3 in January 2004, the Mazda5 in the summer of 2005, the MX-5 in October 2005, and the CX-7 in November 2006. The 2003 Mazda6 is essentially the sixth generation Mazda 626, as the Mazda6 continues on the G platform, progressing from the GF-platform 626/Capella to the GG-platform Mazda6. This picture shows a 2003 Mazda6 hatchback in Classic trim.
